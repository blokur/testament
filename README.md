## Introduction

These are common tools we usually use in our tests.

| AssertInError      | Check if an error is found in a deeply nested errors                   |
| RandomString       | Generates a randomly generated string by given length                  |
| GetFreeOpenPort    | Returns a port that is already claimed.                                |
| GetFreePort        | Returns a random open port.                                            |
| RandomString       | Returns a randomly generates string with the length of count.          |
| RandomLowerString  | Returns a randomly generates lower-cased string with a maximum length. |
| StringSlice        | Return a string slice with the provided length.                        |
| RandomStringSlice  | Return a random string slice with maximum length.                      |
| IntSlice           | Returns a slice of int elements with the provided length.              |
| RandIntSlice       | Returns a slice of int elements with random length of less than n.     |
| Int32Slice         |                                                                        |

## Development

### Prerequisite

This project supports Go >= `1.17`. To run targets from the `Makefile` you need
to install GNU make.

In order to install dependencies:

```bash
make dependencies
```

This also installs [reflex][reflex] to help with development process.

### Running Tests

To watch for file changes and run unit_test:

```bash
make unit_test_watch
# or to run them with race flag:
make unit_test_race_watch
```

There is also a `integration_test` target for running integration tests.

### Make Examples

```bash
make                           # shows help on targets.
make unit_test
make unit_test run=TestMyTest   # runs a specific test with regexp.
make unit_test dir=./path/...   # runs tests in a package.
make unit_test dir=./path/... run=TestSomethingElse
```

Please see the Makefile for more targets.

### Changelog

You need to update the changelogs file before each release. In order to update
the changelogs file run the following:

```bash
make changelog
```

When you are ready to make a commitment and tag the next release, use this
target and pass in the next tag:

```bash
make changelog_release tag=v1.0.1
```
